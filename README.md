Bubbles the simple, easy to use HTTP web server that is browser controlled, and capable of serving static files over the internet, either streamed from disk, or direct from RAM without lag.

A GUI administration panel is accessed through your web browser (e.g. "http://localhost:1080/admin/" + default password of "admin"), which controls all her settings and vital functions, all in realtime.

Apart from serving files, she is capable of tracking site visits (site counters), receiving emails, accepting contact form submissions with support for Spam Guard, and recording site activity as date stamped traffic logs. She also includes a built-in log analyser for making sense of her traffic logs. These and other features make her more than capable of running multiple websites with little to no headache.

Her design is light and stable, and an extensive block-based memory management system ensures all her key operations use memory in a sustained and reliable manner.
